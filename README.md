###

<h2 align="left">‚ú® Introduction</h2>

###

<p align="left">SSV Network is a unique technology that enables the distributed control and operation of an Ethereum validator.<br><br>SSV uses an MPC threshold scheme with a consensus layer on top (Istanbul BFT), that governs the network.<br>Its core strength is in its robustness and fault tolerance which leads the way for an open network of staking operators to run validators in a decentralized and trustless way.</p>
